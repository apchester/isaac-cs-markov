    "# Text Generation With Markov Chains\n",

    "The goal of the process is to gernerate **original** text that is in the same style as the original inputs.\n",

    "Markov chains are used to model stochastic **(random)** processes that have fixed states and transitions between these states that have probabilites attached to them. There's a lot going on in that sentence, so lets have an example! \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say I have two choices for how to spend my afternoons. I could go to the gym or play video games. If I go to the gym on one day, I have 50% probability of going to the gym the following day (to try and keep up the good habits). If I play computer games on any afternoon I am highly-likely (80% probability) to play computer games the following day (yes I *am* addicted). \n",
    "\n",
    "The transitions from each choice must sum to **1**, so we can infer the chance of me playing video games after going to the gym is 50% and the chance of me going to the gym after playing computer games is 20%. \n",

    "To use the model to generate a sequence of events, we need to pick a start state, and then generate a random value that will decide which state we move to. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have two choices for each state, i.e. remain in the current state or move to the other state. We will say that the interval 0 to X represents the chance of staying in the current state so for gym a number generated less than 0.5 will mean statying in the gym state and an number greater than or equal to 0.5 will transision us to the computer games state. For the computer games state Anything less than 0.8 will keep us playing games! \n",
