I'm walking fast through the traffic lights.
Busy streets and busy lives.
And all we know, is touch and go.
We are alone with our changing minds.
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time.
And I never (never) saw you coming.
And I'll never (never) be the same.
You come around and the armor falls.
Pierce the room like a cannonball.
Now all we know, is don't let go.
We are alone, just you and me.
Up in your room and our slates are clean.
Just twin fire signs.
Four blue eyes.
So you were never a saint and I've loved in shades of wrong.
We learn to live with the pain. Mosaic broken hearts.
But this love is brave and wild.
And I never (never) saw you coming.
And I'll never (never) be the same.
This is a state of grace.
This is the worthwhile fight.
Love is a ruthless game.
Unless you play it good and right.
These are the hands of fate.
You're my Achilles heel.
This is the golden age of something good and right and real.
And I never (never) saw you coming.
And I'll never (never) be the same.
And I never (never) saw you coming.
And I'll never be the same.
So you were never a saint I've loved in shades of wrong.
We learn to live with the pain.
Mosaic broken hearts.
But this love is brave and wild.
This is a state of grace.
This is the worthwhile fight.
Love is a ruthless game.
Unless you play it good and right.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall.
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known.
Missing him was dark grey all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met.
But loving him was red.
Loving him was red.
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you.
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song.
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer.
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known.
Missing him was dark grey all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met.
But loving him was red.
Oh, red.
Burning red.
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes.
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go.
But moving on from him is impossible.
When I still see it all in my head.
In burning red.
Burning, it was red.
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known.
Missing him was dark grey all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met.
Cause loving him was red.
Yeah, yeah, red.
We're burning red
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head.
Comes back to me, burning red.
Yeah, yeah.
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street.
Put your lips close to mine.
As long as they don't touch.
Out of focus, eye to eye.
Till the gravity's too much.
And I'll do anything you say.
If you say it with your hands.
And I'd be smart to walk away.
But you're quicksand.
This slope is treacherous.
This path is reckless.
This slope is treacherous.
And I like it.
I can't decide if it's a choice.
Getting swept away.
I hear the sound of my own voice.
Asking you to stay.
And all we are is skin and bone.
Trained to get along.
Forever going with the flow.
But you're friction.
This slope is treacherous.
This path is reckless.
This slope is treacherous.
I like it.
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night.
And I will get you get you alone.
Your name has echoed through my mind.
And I just think you should, think you should know.
That nothing safe is worth the drive.
And I would follow you, follow you home.
I'll follow you, follow you home.
This hope is treacherous.
This daydream is dangerous.
This hope is treacherous.
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night.
And I will get you, I'll get you alone.
Your name has echoed through my mind.
And I just think you should, think you should know.
That nothing safe is worth the drive.
And I would follow you, follow you home.
I'll follow you, follow you home.
I'll follow you, follow you home.
I'll follow you, follow you home.
This slope is treacherous.
I think I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago.
I was in your sights, you got me alone.
You found me, you found me, you found me.
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that.
And when I fell hard you took a step back.
Without me, without me, without me.
And he's long gone when he's next to me.
And I realize the blame is on me.
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Til you put me down, oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
No apologies. He'll never see you cry.
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street.
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be.
And now I see, now I see, now I see.
He was long gone when he met me.
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
And the saddest fear comes creeping in.
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Til you put me down, oh!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there).
So shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
Trouble, trouble, trouble.
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.
