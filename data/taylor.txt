I'm walking fast through the traffic lights. 
Busy streets and busy lives. 
And all we know is touch and go. 
We are alone with our changing minds. 
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time. 
And I never never saw you coming. 
And I'll never never be the same. 
You come around and the armor falls. 
Pierce the room like a cannonball. 
Now all we know is don't let go. 
We are alone just you and me. 
Up in your room and our slates are clean. 
Just twin fire signs. 
Four blue eyes. 
So you were never a saint and I've loved in shades of wrong. 
We learn to live with the pain.  Mosaic broken hearts. 
But this love is brave and wild. 
And I never never saw you coming. 
And I'll never never be the same. 
This is a state of grace. 
This is the worthwhile fight. 
Love is a ruthless game. 
Unless you play it good and right. 
These are the hands of fate. 
You're my Achilles heel. 
This is the golden age of something good and right and real. 
And I never never saw you coming. 
And I'll never never be the same. 
And I never never saw you coming. 
And I'll never be the same. 
So you were never a saint I've loved in shades of wrong. 
We learn to live with the pain. 
Mosaic broken hearts. 
But this love is brave and wild. 
This is a state of grace. 
This is the worthwhile fight. 
Love is a ruthless game. 
Unless you play it good and right. 
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street. 
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly. 
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall. 
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all. 
Losing him was blue like I'd never known. 
Missing him was dark grey all alone. 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met. 
But loving him was red. 
Loving him was red. 
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you. 
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song. 
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer. 
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong. 
Losing him was blue like I'd never known. 
Missing him was dark grey all alone. 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met. 
But loving him was red. 
Oh red. 
Burning red. 
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes. 
Tell myself it's time now gotta let go. 
But moving on from him is impossible. 
When I still see it all in my head. 
In burning red. 
Burning it was red. 
Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known. 
Missing him was dark grey all alone. 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met. 
Cause loving him was red. 
Yeah yeah red. 
We're burning red
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head. 
Comes back to me burning red. 
Yeah yeah. 
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street. 
Put your lips close to mine. 
As long as they don't touch. 
Out of focus eye to eye. 
Till the gravity's too much. 
And I'll do anything you say. 
If you say it with your hands. 
And I'd be smart to walk away. 
But you're quicksand. 
This slope is treacherous. 
This path is reckless. 
This slope is treacherous. 
And I like it. 
I can't decide if it's a choice. 
Getting swept away. 
I hear the sound of my own voice. 
Asking you to stay. 
And all we are is skin and bone. 
Trained to get along. 
Forever going with the flow. 
But you're friction. 
This slope is treacherous. 
This path is reckless. 
This slope is treacherous. 
I like it. 
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night. 
And I will get you get you alone. 
Your name has echoed through my mind. 
And I just think you should think you should know. 
That nothing safe is worth the drive. 
And I would follow you follow you home. 
I'll follow you follow you home. 
This hope is treacherous. 
This daydream is dangerous. 
This hope is treacherous. 
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night. 
And I will get you I'll get you alone. 
Your name has echoed through my mind. 
And I just think you should think you should know. 
That nothing safe is worth the drive. 
And I would follow you follow you home. 
I'll follow you follow you home. 
I'll follow you follow you home. 
I'll follow you follow you home. 
This slope is treacherous. 
I think I think when it's all over
It just comes back in flashes you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories. 
It just all comes back.  But he never does. 
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. 
It's not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along with it. 
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again. 
But I don't know if I should. 
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. 
But I just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me. 
I guess I just lost my balance. 
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him. 
It was losing me. 
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago. 
I was in your sights you got me alone. 
You found me you found me you found me. 
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that. 
And when I fell hard you took a step back. 
Without me without me without me. 
And he's long gone when he's next to me. 
And I realize the blame is on me. 
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Til you put me down oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
No apologies.  He'll never see you cry. 
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why. 
You're drowning you're drowning you're drowning. 
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street. 
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be. 
And now I see now I see now I see. 
He was long gone when he met me. 
And I realize the joke is on me yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Til you put me down oh. 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
And the saddest fear comes creeping in. 
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Til you put me down oh!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there. 
So shame on me now. 
Flew me to places I'd never been. 
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble. 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
Trouble trouble trouble. 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in. 
Trouble trouble trouble. 
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.    
I bet this time of night you're still up. 
I bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city. 
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me. 
And I just wanna tell you it takes everything in me not to call you. 
And I wish I could run to you. 
And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do. 
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you cause each time you reach out there's no reply. 
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say Hello to you and risk another goodbye. 
And I just wanna tell you it takes everything in me not to call you. 
And I wish I could run to you. 
And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do. 
Oh we made quite a mess babe. 
It's probably better off this way. 
And I confess babe in my dreams you're touching my face and asking me if I wanna try again with you. 
And I almost do. 
And I just wanna tell you it takes everything in me not to call you. 
And I wish I could run to you. 
And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do I almost do. 
I bet this time of night you're still up. 
I bet you're tired from a long hard week. 
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city. 
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me. 
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh. 
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight. 
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh. 
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time. 
It's miserable and magical. 
Oh, yeah tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines. 
Uh oh!
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22. 
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you. 
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to. 
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, ooh-ooh 22, ooh-ooh. 
It seems like one of those nights, this place is too crowded. 
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh.  Who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?
It seems like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping. 
Yeah, We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way. 
It's miserable and magical. 
Oh, yeah!
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks. 
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22. 
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you. 
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to. 
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22. 
It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene. 
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping. 
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news. 
I gotta have you, I gotta have you. 
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22. 
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you. 
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to. 
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22. 
It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene. 
It feels like one of those nights, we won't be sleeping. 
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news. 
I gotta have you, I gotta have you. 
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night. 
I threw my phone across the room at you. 
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away, but you stayed. 
This morning I said we should talk about it. 
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.  
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Okay let's talk. 
And I said, stay, stay, stay. 
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. 
But I think that it's best if we both stay. 
Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers, who took all of their problems out on me. 
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'. 
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to. 
Stay, stay, stay. 
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. 
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. 
You took the time to memorize me my fears, my hopes, and dreams. 
I just like hangin' out with you all the time. 
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life. 
Stay.  And I'll be loving you for quite some time. 
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad. 
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. 
Stay, stay, stay. 
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. 
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. 
Stay, stay, stay. 
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. 
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. 
But I think that it's best if we both stay. 
I was reminiscing just the other day while having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away. 
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time. 
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme. 
Took off faster than a green light go. 
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know. 
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made, and that was the first day. 
And darling, it was good never looking down. 
And right there where we stood was holy ground. 
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress, we had this big wide city all to ourselves. 
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you, and for the first time I had something to lose. 
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way. 
And the story’s got dust on every page but sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. 
And I see your face in every crowd. 
Cause darling, it was good never looking down. 
And right there where we stood was holy ground. 
Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. 
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. 
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.  
It was good never looking down. 
And right there where we stood was holy ground. 
Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through. 
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. 
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room. 
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you. 
I would be complex, I would be cool. 
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to. 
And that would be okay for me to do. 
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you. 
I'd be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type. 
When everyone believes ya.   What's that like?
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man. 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again. 
Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man.  I'd be the man.  I'd be the man. 
They'd say I hustled, put in the work. 
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve. 
What I was wearing, if I was rude. 
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves. 
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play. 
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez. 
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man. 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again. 
Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man. 
I'd be the man. 
I'd be the man. 
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars and getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad. 
And it's okay if you're mad. 
If I was out flashing my dollars. 
I'd be a bitch, not a baller. 
They'd paint me out to be bad so, it's okay that I'm mad. 
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man. 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again. 
Cause if I was a man then I'd be the man. 
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can.  Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man. 
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again. 
Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man. 
If I was a man, then I'd be the man. 
The moon is high. 
Like your friends were the night that we first met. 
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet. 
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed. 
The wine is cold, like the shoulder that I gave you in the street. 
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three. 
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe. 
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night. 
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright. 
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life. 
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings. 
Uh huh, that's right. 
Darling, you're the one I want, and I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this. 
Uh huh, that's right. 
Darling, you're the one I want. 
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams. 
Oh, you're the one I want. 
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool when you jumped in first, I went in too. 
I'm with you even if it makes me blue. 
Which takes me back to the color that we painted your brother's wall. 
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws we wouldn't be standing here so tall.  
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night. 
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright. 
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life. 
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings. 
Uh huh, that's right. 
Darling, you're the one I want, and I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this. 
Uh huh, that's right. 
Darling, you're the one I want in paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams. 
Oh, you're the one I want. 
I want to drive away with you. 
I want your complications too. 
I want your dreary Mondays. 
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy. 
I want to drive away with you. 
I want your complications too. 
I want your dreary Mondays,
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy. 
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings. 
Uh huh, that's right, you're the one I want. 
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this darling, you're the one I want. 
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings. 
Uh huh, that's right. 
Darling, you're the one I want, and I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this. 
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want. 
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams. 
You're the one I want. 
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams. 
Oh, you're the one I want. 
You're the one I want, one I want. 
You're the one I want, one I want.
